# typescript-web-framework

This is a very simple web framework mocking Marionette Backbone.js Framework. It follows simple model/view pattern and uses callback for event triggering updates of views.

## Prerequisite

If you haven't installed parcel, make sure you did following

```
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

You would also need json-server as a mock server.

```
npm install -g json-server
```

## Running the web framework

```
npm start:db // this will start the mock json-server
npm start:parcel // this will start the web framework
```
